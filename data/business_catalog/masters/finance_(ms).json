The curriculum is designed to provide students with insights from the most advanced theoretical and empirical research in finance while attending professional development seminars. Through the UO's Cameron Center for Finance and Securities Analysis, students have opportunities to practice securities analysis and portfolio management in a live environment with access to the Pacific Northwest's financial, banking, and investment industry.",
  "pre_major_requirements": "The MSF curriculum totals a minimum of 45 credits, allowing students to complete the degree in 12 months (four quarters).\nThe program consists of six required courses - including a capstone practicum and a quarterly seminar - along with 13 available electives. Emphasis is on valuation and asset management. The required core courses have no pre-requisites for MSF students. The program will coordinate with industry partners to design such real-world projects as security analysis, portfolio allocation, risk management, and valuation of corporate investment projects or startups.",

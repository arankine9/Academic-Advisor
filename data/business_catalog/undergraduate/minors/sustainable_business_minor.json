  "program": "Sustainable Business Minor",
  "description": "http://business.uoregon.edu/ug/minors/sustainable-business\nThe minor in sustainable business is designed for non-business majors who want to learn to apply business solutions to address social and environmental challenges. The sustainable business minor teaches students how to use the power of business for good, finding ways to make the world better for everyone.\nThe minor in sustainable business is open to students from all majors except pre-business, business administration, or accounting. For general social sciences majors with a concentration in applied economics, business, and society, students must adhere to the GSS double-dipping policy. See theGSS websitefor more information. Completing the minor requires 24 credits of course work, which can be completed in one academic year.\nIt is possible to earn more than one minor within the Lundquist College of Business. However, for students earning more than one business-related minor, no more than three courses can be used to satisfy multiple business minors.\nStudents may declare a minor in sustainable business online on the college’s website, where a checklist of requirements can be found. Advising assistance is available in the Office of Undergraduate Advising.",
  "pre_major_requirements": "The sustainable business minor consists of three business administration courses, two courses from specialized clusters, and one elective (total of 24 credit hours).\nCourses used to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade and passed with a grade of C- or better.\nBA 101 can be taken as Pass/No Pass and will count toward the minor requirements if passed with a grade of Pass.",

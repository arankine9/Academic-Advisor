  "description": "http://business.uoregon.edu/ug/majors/business-administration\nFor more information, contactlcb.undergrad@uoregon.edu.\nGet ready to make a difference. Students majoring in business administration learn to build their ideas into a small business—or a small business empire. Lead a Fortune 500 company. Market an NFL franchise. Realize financial goals. Take Wall Street (or Main Street) by storm. TheLundquist College of Businessat the University of Oregon can take students where they want to go. Lundquist students are part of an intelligently informal community of thinkers and doers who are serious, determined, focused, and hands-on.\nA degree in business administration is just part of the story. Students can pursue a general business focus or choose aconcentrationin accounting, entrepreneurship, finance, marketing, operations and business analytics, or sports business. They can alsominorin business administration, entrepreneurship, sports business, or sustainable business. No matter which degree or concentration is chosen, the Lundquist College of Business provides a collaborative environment where students find ample opportunities to try out real-world projects and scenarios, giving them career experience before they even graduate.",
  "pre_major_requirements": "For guaranteed admission to the major, students must obtain at least a 3.0 cumulative GPA (including both UO and transfer coursework) and pass all pre-business core classes with a minimum core GPA of 3.00. All pre-major requirements must be taken for a letter grade and passed with a C- or better for admission to the major. BA 240 and AP or IB coursework is acceptable with a grade of P*. The university limits retaking of courses in which a P or mid-C or better is earned. The university also limits attempting a course to a maximum of 3 attempts (including marks of W,N,F,D, C-); a petition is required for an exception. When repeating a core course, only the most recent grade is used in calculating the pre-business core GPA.\nIn addition, international students are required to take Academic English for International Students (AEIS) courses or produce English language proficiency test scores (575 on the TOEFL paper-based test, 89 on the TOEFL internet-based test, or 7.0 in the IELTS).",
  "additional_program_info": "Upper-division core courses typically are completed during junior year.\nStudents must complete a minimum of 44 upper-division credits in regularly scheduled Lundquist College of Business courses. With the department head’s approval, credits may be transferred from other accredited institutions, independent study, or approved courses in other departments.\n\nIt is possible to select business upper division elective courses in such a way to earn a concentration. Concentrations are available in accounting, entrepreneurship, finance, marketing, operations and business analytics, and sports business. For students completing a concentration, four of their seven business electives are met by the concentration courses, and they must complete three more electives. If their concentration courses are all from one department, at least one of their three remaining electives must be from a business department other than their concentration department (Marketing and Sports Business are considered the same department). Concentrations are optional and do not appear on the UO academic transcript or diploma.\nBA courses count as one of the seven electives, but do not count toward the two-department requirement.\nCultural Awareness for Business Decisions requires students take one course (4 credits) that helps them develop a deeper sensitivity to cultural differences and an understanding of how such differences can impact interactions and relationships in a business setting. Students who study abroad or intern for credit in one country for six weeks or more may have the Cultural Awareness requirement waived with the approval of an academic advisor. Students will not be able to apply courses to the upper-division elective requirement and the Cultural Awareness requirement.",

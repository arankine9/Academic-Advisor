The university limits retaking of courses in which a P or mid-C or better is earned. The university also limits attempting a course to a maximum of 3 attempts (including marks of W,N,F,D, C-); a petition is required for an exception. When repeating a core course, only the most recent grade is used in calculating the pre-business core GPA.\nIn addition, international students are required to take Academic English for International Students (AEIS) courses or produce English language proficiency test scores (575 on the TOEFL paper-based test, 89 on the TOEFL internet-based test, or 7.0 in the IELTS).",

With the department head’s approval, credits may be transferred from other accredited institutions, independent study, or approved courses in other departments.  Accounting majors must complete all upper-division accounting courses at the University of Oregon.\nThe 3+1 Accounting Pathway is an accelerated program for accounting majors, an opportunity for qualified incoming freshman students interested in accounting to complete their bachelor’s degree and master of accounting degree within four years. Through an evaluation of college-ready credits (e.g., Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate programs), high-achieving students are fast-tracked for admission to the Lundquist College of Business one full year before their contemporaries.

Students who study abroad or intern for credit in one country for six weeks or more may have the Cultural Awareness requirement waived with the approval of an academic advisor.\n\nThe 400-level courses are typically taken in the senior year. Upper-division accounting credits applied toward the major must be taken at the Lundquist College.Exceptions require explicit approval from the Director of the School of Accounting.\nStudents pursuing the certified public accountant (CPA) designation are required to take additional course work prior to sitting for the Certified Public Accountant Examination.",

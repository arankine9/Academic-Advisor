The entrepreneurship minor gives students the opportunity to envision, develop, test, and build a for-profit or nonprofit venture working within an interdisciplinary framework of exploration and self-discovery.\nThe minor in entrepreneurship is open to students from all majors except pre-business, business administration, or accounting. For general social sciences majors with a concentration in applied economics, business, and society, students must adhere to the GSS double-dipping policy. See theGSS websitefor more information. Completing the minor requires 24 credits of course work, which can be completed in one academic year.\nIt is possible to earn more than one minor within the Lundquist College of Business. However, for students earning more than one business-related minor, no more than three courses can be used to satisfy multiple business minors.\nStudents may declare a minor in entrepreneurship online at the college’swebsite, where a checklist of requirements can be found.

No other program inspires individual distinction and deep and practical experience like the Oregon MBA. Earn an MBA with a specialization in one of four select areas: finance and securities analysis, innovation and entrepreneurship, sports business, and sustainable business practices. The four specializations of the MBA curriculum are aligned with the college’s centers of excellence—the Lundquist Center for Entrepreneurship, the Cameron Center for Finance and Securities Analysis, the Center for Sustainable Business Practices, and the James H. Warsaw Sports Center. The centers promote research collaboration among faculty members from different departments, facilitate student interactions with industry professionals, and provide practical, real-world learning opportunities.\nStrong faculty involvement and the state-of-the art facilities of the Lillis Business Complex create an ideal learning environment. An emphasis on group work ensures that students get to know one another and their instructors well. In addition, a strong cohort model aids in developing solid working relationships and strong friendships. Finally, students enhance their education by participating in global and domestic experiential learning trips and co-curricular opportunities offered through the college’s Professional Edge Program.\nTwo years of full-time study are needed to earn the minimum of 76 credits required for the degree. See thewebsitefor more information and admission requirements.\nThe accelerated master’s degree program is intensive, allowing outstanding undergraduate majors in business from an accredited institution to earn an MBA degree in 15 months by taking a minimum of 49 credits over four terms. Applicants should have a strong overall academic record and significant full-time work experience. Students choose one of the four specializations listed above. See thewebsitefor more information.",
